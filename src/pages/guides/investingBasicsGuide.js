      text: "Inflation gradually erodes the purchasing power of money sitting in savings accounts. While your money may be 'safe' in a bank, it's actually losing value over time if the interest rate is lower than inflation. Investing helps your money grow faster than inflation, preserving and increasing your purchasing power."

      text: "The power of compound interest means that even small amounts invested regularly can grow into substantial sums over time. Starting early gives your investments more time to compound, which is why time in the market is often more important than timing the market."
